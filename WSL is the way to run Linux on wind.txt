WSL is the way to run Linux on windows 
how container made ? 
- name space is the way to isolate certain process, and can have public IP to communicate
- C groups to allocate resources to my process created by name space 
- container is one process if fail app crash 
- container less secure than VM

Docker file, docker image, docker container 
vs code exstentions (docker, containers tool)
port forwarding 
cat *os*
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

Docker file:
FROM to get image from docker hub
COPY file-name destination_in_docker
RUN add shell command here 
CMD 2a5er 7aga will run once image start
WORKDIR /App (to create workdir inside my image once run)

Docker architecture:
client -> app or engine installed in my server
docker demon -> da el 3akl el modaber b2a 
inside demon: we have our images and container
